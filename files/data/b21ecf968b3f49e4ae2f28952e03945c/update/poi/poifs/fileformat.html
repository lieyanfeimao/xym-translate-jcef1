     <p>POIFS file systems are essentially normal files stored on a Java-compatible platform's native file system. They are typically identified by names ending in a four character extension noting what type of data they contain. For example, a file ending in ".xls" would likely contain spreadsheet data, and a file ending in ".doc" would probably contain a word processing document. POIFS file systems are called "file system", because they contain multiple embedded files in a manner similar to traditional file systems. Along functional lines, it would be more accurate to call these POIFS archives. For the remainder of this document it is referred to as a file system in order to avoid confusion with the "files" it contains.
      <div name="tsUpdate" data-id="t_a4d29cdbce8f4ae091aa4fac2d9bf651" data-tpl="0" data-txt-color="green"></div></p>
     <p>POIFS file systems are compatible with those document formats used by a well-known software company's popular office productivity suite and programs outputting compatible data. Because the POIFS file system does not provide compression, encryption or any other worthwhile feature, its not a good choice unless you require interoperability with these programs.

     <p>The POIFS file system does not encode the documents themselves. For example, if you had a word processor file with the extension ".doc", you would actually have a POIFS file system with a document file archived inside of that file system.

     <p>Note - this document is a good overview and explanation of the file format, but for the very nitty-gritty details, you should refer to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd942138%28v=prot.13%29.aspx">[MS-CFB].pdf</a> in the (now public) Microsoft Documentation.

     <p>The Java Language Specification spells out a number of other types that are not referred to by this document.

     <p>Where this document makes references to "endian conversion" it is referring to the byte order of stored numbers. Numbers in "little-endian order" are stored with the <em>least</em> significant byte first. In order to properly read a short, for example, you'd read two bytes and then shift the second byte 8 bits to the left before performing an <span class="codefrag">or</span> operation to it against the first byte. The following code illustrates this method:

     <p>This is a walkthrough of a POIFS file system and how it is put together. It is not intended to give a concise description but to give a "big picture" of the general structure and how it's interpreted.
      <div name="tsUpdate" data-id="t_aedf5899470948959e07516b16db2a55" data-tpl="0" data-txt-color="green"></div></p>
     <p>A POIFS file system begins with a header. This header identifies locations in the file by function and provides a sanity check identifying a file as a POIFS file system.
      <div name="tsUpdate" data-id="t_39a417ad0cca491aa16b6f3975b96c5a" data-tpl="0" data-txt-color="green"></div></p>
     <p>The first 64 bits of the header compose a <em>magic number identifier.</em> This identifier tells the client software that this is indeed a POIFS file system and that it should be treated as such. This is a "sanity check" to make sure this is a POIFS file system and not some other format. The header also contains an <em>array of block numbers</em>. These block numbers refer to blocks in the file. When these blocks are read together they form the <em>Block Allocation Table</em>. The header also contains a pointer to the first element in the <em>property table</em>, also known as the <em>root element</em>, and a pointer to the <em>small Block Allocation Table (SBAT)</em>.
      <div name="tsUpdate" data-id="t_4cb28706d3484c27859d4e03acfcdc33" data-tpl="0" data-txt-color="green"></div></p>
     <p>The <em>block allocation table</em> or <em>BAT</em>, along with the <em>property table</em>, specify which blocks in the file system belong to which files. After the header block, the file system is divided into identically sized blocks of data, numbered from 0 to however many blocks there are in the file system. For each file in the file system, its entry in the property table includes the index of the first block in the array of blocks. Each block's index into the array of blocks is also its index into the BAT, and the integer value stored at that index in the BAT gives the index of the next block in the array (and thus the index of the next BAT value). A special value is stored in the BAT to indicate "end of file".
      <div name="tsUpdate" data-id="t_01a26f2e44904ba9a3c4b6aec4ec3c8c" data-tpl="0" data-txt-color="green"></div></p>
     <p>The <em>property table</em> is essentially the directory storage for the file system. It consists of the name of the file or directory, its <em>start block</em> in both the file system and <em>BAT</em>, and its actual size. The first property in the property table is the <em>root element</em>. It has two purposes: to be a directory entry (the root of the directory tree, to be specific), and to hold the start block for the <em>small block data</em>.
      <div name="tsUpdate" data-id="t_f282eb10fde444fba75007b38f699f84" data-tpl="0" data-txt-color="green"></div></p>
     <p>Small block data is a special file that contains the data for small files (less than 4K bytes). It subdivides its blocks into smaller blocks and there is a special small block allocation table that, like the main BAT for larger files, is used to map a small file to its small blocks.
      <div name="tsUpdate" data-id="t_db977865462f47149fa7fd018ea90f0b" data-tpl="0" data-txt-color="green"></div></p>

     <p>The POIFS file system begins with a <em>header block</em>. The first 64 bits of the header form a long <em>file type id</em> or <em>magic number identifier</em> of <span class="codefrag">0xE11AB1A1E011CFD0L</span>. This is basically a sanity check. If this isn't the first thing in the header (and consequently the file system) then this is not a POIFS file system and should be read with some other library.
      <div name="tsUpdate" data-id="t_f706e1acd3174e2b80713e64e8d666af" data-tpl="0" data-txt-color="green"></div></p>
     <p>It's important to know the most important parts of the header. These are discussed in the rest of this section.
      <div name="tsUpdate" data-id="t_99fa59064d624021946bc09c37ae6b09" data-tpl="0" data-txt-color="green"></div></p>

     <h4>BATs

     <p>At offset <em>0x2C</em> is an int specifying the number of elements in the <em>BAT array</em>. The array at <em>0x4C</em> an array of ints. This array contains the indices of every block in the Block Allocation Table.
      <div name="tsUpdate" data-id="t_811a5899301340d4988ed03a3da31d6e" data-tpl="0" data-txt-color="green"></div></p>

     <p>Very large POIFS archives may have more blocks than can be addressed by the BAT blocks enumerated in the header block. How large? Well, the BAT array in the header can contain up to 109 BAT block indices; each BAT block references up to 128 blocks, and each block is 512 bytes, so we're talking about 109 * 128 * 512 = 6.8MB. That's a pretty respectable document! But, you could have much more data than that, and in today's world of cheap gigabyte drives, why not? So, the BAT may be extended in that event. The integer value at offset <em>0x44</em> of the header is the index of the first <em>extended BAT (XBAT) block</em>. At offset <em>0x48</em> of the header, there is an int value that specifies how many XBAT blocks there are. The XBAT blocks begin at the specified index into the array of blocks making up the POIFS file system, and are chained for the specified count of XBAT blocks.
      <div name="tsUpdate" data-id="t_47096826d4a94092bd3fb9ffdf5bf867" data-tpl="0" data-txt-color="green"></div></p>
     <p>Each XBAT block contains the indices of up to 127 BAT blocks, so the document size can be expanded by another ~8MB for each XBAT block. The BAT blocks indexed by an XBAT block are appended to the end of the list of BAT blocks enumerated in the header block. Thus the BAT blocks enumerated in the header block are BAT blocks 0 through 108, the BAT blocks enumerated in the first XBAT block are BAT blocks 109 through 235, the BAT blocks enumerated in the second XBAT block are BAT blocks 236 through 362, and so on.
      <div name="tsUpdate" data-id="t_83e5834718474e40842cf7cca308ccab" data-tpl="0" data-txt-color="green"></div></p>
     <p>While a normal BAT block holds 128 entries, each XBAT only references 127 BAT blocks. The last, 128th entry in an XBAT is the offset to the next XBAT block in the chain (or -1 if this is the last XBAT).
      <div name="tsUpdate" data-id="t_0e17b8cae3624cbe991cd2c040ef858f" data-tpl="0" data-txt-color="green"></div></p>
     <p>Through the use of XBAT blocks, the limit on the overall document size is that imposed by the 4-byte block indices; if the indices are unsigned ints, the maximum file size is 2 terabytes, 1 terabyte if the indices are treated as signed ints. Either way, I have yet to see a disk drive large enough to accommodate such a file on the shelves at the local office supply stores.
      <div name="tsUpdate" data-id="t_961e8a6d794c4fc49d327aa77dd137dc" data-tpl="0" data-txt-color="green"></div></p>

     <p>If a file contained in a POIFS archive is smaller than 4096 bytes, it is stored in small blocks. Small blocks are 64 bytes in length and are contained within big blocks, up to 8 to a big block. As the main BAT is used to navigate the array of big blocks, so the <em>small block allocation table</em> is used to navigate the array of small blocks. The SBAT's start block index is found at offset <em>0x3C</em> of the header block, and remaining blocks constituting the SBAT are found by walking the main BAT as if it were an ordinary file in the POIFS file system (this process is described below).
      <div name="tsUpdate" data-id="t_e319e690e4a1412cb99cacb752533848" data-tpl="0" data-txt-color="green"></div></p>

     <p>An integer at address <em>0x30</em> specifies the start index of the property table. This integer is specified as a <em>"block index"</em>. The Property Table is stored, as is almost everything in a POIFS file system, in big blocks and walked via the BAT. The Property Table is described below.
      <div name="tsUpdate" data-id="t_87155ce3af904ed4a60ccd79b484c6a1" data-tpl="0" data-txt-color="green"></div></p>

     <p>The property table is essentially nothing more than the directory system. Properties are 128 byte records contained within the 512 byte blocks. The first property is always the Root Entry. The following applies to individual properties within a property table:
      <div name="tsUpdate" data-id="t_c02114d643a947898c4d8272aab89f0a" data-tpl="0" data-txt-color="green"></div></p>
     <ul>
      <li>At offset <em>0x00</em> in the property is the "<em>name</em>". This is stored as an uncompressed 16 bit unicode string. In short every other byte corresponds to an "ASCII" character. The size of this string is stored at offset <em>0x40</em> (<em>string size</em>) as a short.
       <div name="tsUpdate" data-id="t_8257a6c5093a47af8b3a2559481800ee" data-tpl="0" data-txt-color="green"></div></li>
      <li>At offset <em>0x42</em> is the <em>property type</em> (byte). The type is 1 for directory, 2 for file or 5 for the Root Entry.
       <div name="tsUpdate" data-id="t_ad924f288a8a42ab8407de3996e435ff" data-tpl="0" data-txt-color="green"></div></li>
      <li>At offset <em>0x43</em> is the <em>node color</em> (byte). The color is either 1, (black), or 0, (red). Properties are apparently meant to be arranged in a red-black binary tree, subject to the following rules:
       <ol>
        <li>The root of the tree is always black
         <div name="tsUpdate" data-id="t_9e0c24f261b64ff7a0c77b15e6ec6df9" data-tpl="0" data-txt-color="green"></div></li>
        <li>Two consecutive nodes cannot both be red

        <li>A property is less than another property if its name length is less than the other property's name length

        <li>If two properties have the same name length, the sort order is determined by the sort order of the properties' names.

      <li>At offset <em>0x44</em> is the index (int) of the <em>previous property</em>.

      <li>At offset <em>0x4C</em> is the index (int) of the <em>first directory entry</em>. This is used by directory entries.
       <div name="tsUpdate" data-id="t_5f00dd993b704097af8097dca6acc2a6" data-tpl="0" data-txt-color="green"></div></li>
      <li>At offset <em>0x74</em> is an integer giving the <em>start block</em> for the file described by this property. This index corresponds to an index in the array of indices that is the Block Allocation Table (or the Small Block Allocation Table) as well as the index of the first block in the file. This is used by files and the root entry.

      <li>At offset <em>0x78</em> is an integer giving the total <em>actual size</em> of the file pointed at by this property. If the file size is less than 4096, the file is stored in small blocks and the SBAT is used to walk the small blocks making up the file. If the file size is 4096 or larger, the file is stored in big blocks and the main BAT is used to walk the big blocks making up the file. The exception to this rule is the <em>Root Entry</em>, which, regardless of its size, is <em>always</em> stored in big blocks and the main BAT is used to walk the big blocks making up this special file.

     <p>The <em>Root Entry</em> in the <em>Property Table</em> contains the information necessary to read and write small files, which are files less than 4096 bytes long. The start block field of the Root Entry is the start index of the <em>Small Block Array</em>, which is read like any other file in the POIFS file system. Since the SBAT cannot be used without the Small Block Array, the Root Entry MUST be read or written using the <em>Block Allocation Table</em>. The blocks making up the Small Block Array are divided into 64-byte small blocks, up to the size indicated in the Root Entry (which should always be a multiple of 64).

     <p>The individual properties form a directory tree, with the <em>Root Entry</em> as the directory tree's root, as shown in the accompanying drawing. Note the numbers in parentheses in each node; they represent the node's index in the array of properties. The <em>NEXT_PROP</em>, <em>PREVIOUS_PROP</em>, and <em>CHILD_PROP</em> fields hold these indices, and are used to navigate the tree.
      <div name="tsUpdate" data-id="t_93f2c08cb307432facc4d87eb0a58920" data-tpl="0" data-txt-color="green"></div></p>
     <p><img alt="property set" src="images/PropertySet.jpg"></p>
     <p>Each directory entry (i.e., a property whose type is <em>directory</em> or <em>root entry</em>) uses its <em>CHILD_PROP</em> field to point to one of its subordinate (child) properties. It doesn't seem to matter which of its children it points to. Thus in the previous drawing, the Root Entry's CHILD_PROP field may contain 1, 4, or the index of one of its other children. Similarly, the directory node (index 1) may have, in its CHILD_PROP field, 2, 3, or the index of one of its other children.

     <p>The children of a given directory property point to each other in a similar fashion by using their <em>NEXT_PROP</em> and <em>PREVIOUS_PROP</em> fields.
      <div name="tsUpdate" data-id="t_c73ecf51bb2047b59f8b3aebc3054317" data-tpl="0" data-txt-color="green"></div></p>
     <p>Unused <em>NEXT_PROP</em>, <em>PREVIOUS_PROP</em>, and <em>CHILD_PROP</em> fields contain the marker value of -1. All file properties have a value of -1 for their CHILD_PROP fields for example.

     <p>The <em>BAT blocks</em> are pointed at by the bat array contained in the header and supplemented, if necessary, by the <em>XBAT blocks</em>. These blocks form a large table of integers. These integers are block numbers. The <em>Block Allocation Table</em> holds chains of integers. These chains are terminated with -2. The elements in these chains refer to blocks in the files. The starting block of a file is NOT specified in the BAT. It is specified by the <em>property</em> for a given file. The elements in this BAT are both the block number (within the file minus the header) <em>and</em> the number of the next BAT element in the chain. This can be thought of as a linked list of blocks. The BAT array contains the links from one block to the next, including the end of chain marker.
      <div name="tsUpdate" data-id="t_a0332aaeb8ed4dbda2a802f677f54283" data-tpl="0" data-txt-color="green"></div></p>
     <p>Here's an example: Let's assume that the BAT begins as follows:
      <div name="tsUpdate" data-id="t_1fa410aa30c248d2a1821fbc2f41f8f8" data-tpl="0" data-txt-color="green"></div></p>

     <p><span class="codefrag">BAT[ 1 ] = 5</span>
      <div name="tsUpdate" data-id="t_4f406a4e335c4609a31ae1485c80233e" data-tpl="0" data-txt-color="green"></div></p>
     <p><span class="codefrag">BAT[ 2 ] = 3</span>
      <div name="tsUpdate" data-id="t_09f3267342714a57a6145462599be796" data-tpl="0" data-txt-color="green"></div></p>
     <p><span class="codefrag">BAT[ 3 ] = 4</span>
      <div name="tsUpdate" data-id="t_e82d8d64a8be484198eb8c5a726517b3" data-tpl="0" data-txt-color="green"></div></p>
     <p><span class="codefrag">BAT[ 4 ] = 6</span>
      <div name="tsUpdate" data-id="t_8fbc138209934302a419f734cc7b4766" data-tpl="0" data-txt-color="green"></div></p>
     <p><span class="codefrag">BAT[ 5 ] = -2</span>
      <div name="tsUpdate" data-id="t_681ca333b5254de0aad09308b383a7de" data-tpl="0" data-txt-color="green"></div></p>
     <p><span class="codefrag">BAT[ 6 ] = 7</span>
      <div name="tsUpdate" data-id="t_0ce015baef554ba7989478d091bda5a7" data-tpl="0" data-txt-color="green"></div></p>
     <p><span class="codefrag">BAT[ 7 ] = -2</span>
      <div name="tsUpdate" data-id="t_b14efdb493e34927807ccec1982c266c" data-tpl="0" data-txt-color="green"></div></p>

      <div name="tsUpdate" data-id="t_57d0164583ac405097cb83271af804af" data-tpl="0" data-txt-color="green"></div></p>
     <p>Now, if we have a file whose Property Table entry says it begins with index 0, we walk the BAT array and see that the file consists of blocks 0 (because the start block is 0), 2 (because BAT[ 0 ] is 2), 3 (BAT[ 2 ] is 3), 4 (BAT[ 3 ] is 4), 6 (BAT[ 4 ] is 6), and 7 (BAT[ 6 ] is 7). It ends at block 7 because BAT[ 7 ] is -2, which is the end of chain marker.

     <p>Similarly, a file beginning at index 1 consists of blocks 1 and 5.

     <p>Other special numbers in a BAT array are:

      <li>-3, which indicates a "special" block, such as a block used to make up the Small Block Array, the Property Table, the main BAT, or the SBAT
