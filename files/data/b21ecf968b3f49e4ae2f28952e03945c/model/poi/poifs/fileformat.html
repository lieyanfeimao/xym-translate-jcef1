     <p><span lg_en="t_a4d29cdbce8f4ae091aa4fac2d9bf651">POIFS file systems are essentially normal files stored on a Java-compatible platform's native file system. They are typically identified by names ending in a four character extension noting what type of data they contain. For example, a file ending in ".xls" would likely contain spreadsheet data, and a file ending in ".doc" would probably contain a word processing document. POIFS file systems are called "file system", because they contain multiple embedded files in a manner similar to traditional file systems. Along functional lines, it would be more accurate to call these POIFS archives. For the remainder of this document it is referred to as a file system in order to avoid confusion with the "files" it contains.</span><span class="tscolor" lg_zh="t_a4d29cdbce8f4ae091aa4fac2d9bf651"><span lg_kh="1">(</span>${t_a4d29cdbce8f4ae091aa4fac2d9bf651}<span lg_kh="1">)</span></span></p>

Because the POIFS file system does not provide compression, encryption or any other worthwhile feature, its not a good choice unless you require interoperability with these programs.</span><span class="tscolor" lg_zh="t_61a5dbb46b48454dbc77a850863df6f1"><span lg_kh="1">(</span>${t_61a5dbb46b48454dbc77a850863df6f1}<span lg_kh="1">)</span></span></p>

This is a "sanity check" to make sure this is a POIFS file system and not some other format. The header also contains an <em>array of block numbers</em>. These block numbers refer to blocks in the file. When these blocks are read together they form the <em>Block Allocation Table</em>.

After the header block, the file system is divided into identically sized blocks of data, numbered from 0 to however many blocks there are in the file system. For each file in the file system, its entry in the property table includes the index of the first block in the array of blocks. Each block's index into the array of blocks is also its index into the BAT, and the integer value stored at that index in the BAT gives the index of the next block in the array (and thus the index of the next BAT value).

Well, the BAT array in the header can contain up to 109 BAT block indices; each BAT block references up to 128 blocks, and each block is 512 bytes, so we're talking about 109 * 128 * 512 = 6.8MB.

At offset <em>0x48</em> of the header, there is an int value that specifies how many XBAT blocks there are.
