[{"id":"t_006b7214bb274a129aee4470e4afa173","oldText":"Program elements annotated @Removal track the earliest final release when a deprecated feature will be removed. This is an internal decoration: a feature may be removed in a release earlier or later than the release number specified by this annotation. The POI project policy is to deprecate an element for 2 final releases before removing. This annotation exists to make it easier to follow up on the second step of the two-step deprecate and remove process. A deprecated feature may be removed in nightly and beta releases prior to the final release for which it is eligible, but may be removed later for various reasons. If it is known in advance that the feature will not be removed in the n+2 release, a later version should be specified by this annotation. The annotation version number should not include beta For example, a feature with a @deprecated POI 3.15 beta 3 is deprecated in POI 3.15 and 3.16 and becomes eligible for deletion during the POI 3.17 release series, and may be deleted immediately after POI 3.16 is released. This would be annotated @Removal(version\u003d\"3.17\") .","tlText":"注释@Removal的程序元素跟踪删除不推荐的功能的最早最终版本。这是一个内部装饰：功能可能会在早于或晚于此注释指定的版本号的版本中删除。DOE项目政策是在删除之前放弃2个最终版本的元素。此注释的存在是为了更容易跟进两步弃用和删除过程的第二步。已弃用的功能可能会在符合资格的最终版本之前在夜间和测试版版本中删除，但稍后可能会因各种原因删除。如果事先知道该功能不会在n+2版本中删除，则应通过此注释指定更高版本。注释版本号不应包括测试版例如，具有@ debrecated的DOE 3.15 Beta 3的功能在DOE 3.15和3.16中被废弃，并且在DOE 3.17发布系列期间有资格删除，并且可能在DOE 3.16发布后立即删除。这将被注释为@Removal（版本\u003d“3.17”）。","version":0},{"id":"t_1640d7802cef4ff8b9f26ba8c4a945e4","oldText":"The POI version when this feature may be removed.","tlText":"可能会删除此功能时的兴趣点版本。","version":0},{"id":"t_039d182eaac54211b2cdc580c5a4775d","oldText":"The POI version when this feature may be removed.
