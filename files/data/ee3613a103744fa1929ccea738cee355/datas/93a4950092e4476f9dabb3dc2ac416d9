A class implementing Duplicatable provides a deep-copy of itself - usually this is done via a copy-constructor, which is invoked with a self-reference by the copy method. References to child objects are duplicated - references to parents are kept as-is and might need to be replaced by the parent copy operation.","tlText":"这是Cloneable界面的替代方案，没有副作用。实现Duplicatable的类提供了自身的深度副本-通常这是通过复制构造器完成的，该构造器由复制方法通过自引用来调用。对子对象的引用是重复的-对父对象的引用按原样保留，并且可能需要用父复制操作替换。","version":0},{"id":"t_4127b8c8131b47b3b505ad3e281c337b","oldText":"a deep copy of the implementing class / instance","tlText":"实现类/实例的深副本","version":0}]
