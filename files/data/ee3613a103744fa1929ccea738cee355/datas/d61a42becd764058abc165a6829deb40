[{"id":"t_31db3d1f7f274858ba3ab66571876ff0","oldText":"Interface used by the TempFile utility class to create temporary files. Classes that implement a TempFileCreationStrategy attempt to handle the cleanup of temporary files. Examples include: DefaultTempFileCreationStrategy deletes temporary files when the JVM exits. This may not be suitable for long-running applications that never shut down the JVM since the list of registered files and disk space usage would grow for as long as the JVM is running. You may wish to implement your own strategy that meets the needs of your situation. A strategy that keeps the n most-recent files, discarding older files on a first-in, first-out basis. A java.util.Deque or org.apache.commons.collections4.queue.CircularFifoQueue may be helpful for achieving this. A strategy that keeps track of every temporary file that has been created by the class or instance and provides a method to explicitly delete the temporary files in the reverse order that they were created. This is the same as DefaultTempFileCreationStrategy, except the strategy class would maintain the list of files to delete rather than or in addition to DeleteOnExitHook maintaining the list, and the files could be deleted before the JVM exit. A strategy that creates a directory that is deleted on JVM exit. Any files inside the directory do not need to be registered since the entire directory will be deleted at exit. This could be dangerous if files were added to the temporary directory outside of this TempFileCreationStrategy\u0027s control. This could be accomplished with createTempDirectory(String) and creating regular (unregistered) files in the temp directory.","tlText":"TempFile实用程序类用于创建临时文件的接口。实现TempFilCreationStrategy的类尝试处理临时文件的清理。示例包括：defaultTempFileNCreationStrategy在Java退出时删除临时文件。这可能不适合长期运行的应用程序，因为只要Java运行，已注册文件列表和磁盘空间使用量就会增长。您可能希望实施符合您情况需要的自己的策略。一种策略，保留n个最新的文件，按照先进先出的原则丢弃旧文件。一个java.util.Deque或org.apache.commons.collections4.table.CircularFifoQueue可能有助于实现这一点。一种策略，它跟踪类或实例创建的每个临时文件，并提供一种方法来显式删除临时文件，删除顺序与创建临时文件的顺序相反。这与Protect TempFileCreationStrategy相同，只是策略类将维护要删除的文件列表，而不是DeleteOnExitHook维护列表，并且可以在退出Java之前删除这些文件。一种创建一个目录的策略，该目录在Java退出时被删除。目录内的任何文件都不需要注册，因为整个目录将在退出时被删除。如果将文件添加到此TempFilCreationStrategy控制之外的临时目录中，这可能会很危险。这可以通过卸载TempDirector（字符串）并在临时目录中创建常规（未注册）文件来实现。","version":0},{"id":"t_b4ff8c66aef44eec994d434c5c162a53","oldText":"Creates a new and empty temporary directory.","tlText":"创建一个新的空临时目录。","version":0},{"id":"t_c9d888a0f05d4899bd51c7a565affef2","oldText":"Creates a new and empty temporary file.","tlText":"创建一个新的空临时文件。","version":0},{"id":"t_c3832cba7e6843209f4bccf7c8805d9f","oldText":"Creates a new and empty temporary file.","tlText":"创建一个新的空临时文件。","version":0},{"id":"t_19e3e9331f72463db28c1788d757405d","oldText":"prefix - The prefix to be used to generate the name of the temporary file.","tlText":"prefuse-用于生成临时文件名称的前置。","version":0},{"id":"t_f74b9964eae44ab58a7f833a8edad4ef","oldText":"suffix - The suffix to be used to generate the name of the temporary file.","tlText":"后缀-用于生成临时文件名称的后缀。","version":0},{"id":"t_51a6b38028b440bbb3012586b1af0bb7","oldText":"The path to the newly created and empty temporary file.","tlText":"新创建的空临时文件的路径。","version":0},{"id":"t_712db2a688a04ce2bb6739133d1bb5f2","oldText":"java.io.IOException - If no temporary file could be created.","tlText":"java.io.
